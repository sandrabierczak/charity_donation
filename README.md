The aim of the project is to create a place where everyone can donate unnecessary things to trusted institutions.

## Where did the idea for the project come from?

- The user has things at home that they want to get rid of, but do not know how.
- There are many solutions available, but many of them require additional effort or are mistrusted. You have to go to verified places, and there is no time / there is no way to go there, and the containers at home or local collections are unverified and it is not known whether these things will actually go
